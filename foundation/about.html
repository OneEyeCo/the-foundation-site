    <h1>About Smiling Donuts</h1>
    <p>Smiling Donuts is a friendly and savory donut-and-pastry shop <br>
    that can cater to every donut needs and requirements of our customers.</p> 
    <p>Everyday, we bake our donuts and frost them with both traditional and vegan donut ingredients from our new recipes <br> 
    that can satisfy any craving, any dietary need, and any eco-friendly and environmental requirements <br> 
    from people who loves traditional or vegan donuts and want to add a little sweetness in their everyday lives.</p>
    
    <p>The creators behind this fantatsically sweet idea are none other than Chase Goddard and Alexia Kim,<br>
    two college students specializing in Graphic Design at Nossi College of Art who collaborated on this website to bring it to life,</p> 
    <p>and who loves donuts and other sweet cravings as much as anyone would ever love to eat a donut!<br> 
    The inspiration for this website comes from many famous donut shops around in Nashville such as the Krispy Kreme and Dunkin Donuts,<br> 
    as well as a vegan donut shop in Marvel: Rising TV series called Excelsior Vegan Donuts, to which is paid a tribute in our website.</p>
